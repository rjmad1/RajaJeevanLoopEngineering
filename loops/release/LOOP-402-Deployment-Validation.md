## Purpose

To establish a standardized procedure and workflow for Deployment Validation within the Release lifecycle, ensuring consistency and reliability across the platform.
## Problem Statement

Without a dedicated Deployment Validation loop, teams often face ad-hoc execution, leading to fragmentation, potential regressions, and operational overhead during Release activities.
## Why This Loop Exists

This loop abstracts the complexity of Deployment Validation into a repeatable, automated pipeline, minimizing human error and standardizing the process across all services.
## Scope

Covers all primary operations related to Deployment Validation. Out of scope: specialized, off-band procedures not part of the standard Release workflows.
## Inputs

- Initial context regarding Deployment Validation
- Relevant source files and configurations
- Environmental constraints for Release
## Outputs

- Executed Deployment Validation changes
- Validation reports
- Documentation updates
## Dependencies

- External services required for Release
- Prior state validation
## Trigger

Triggered manually by an engineer or automatically via a scheduled Release orchestration event.---

## Scheduling

- **Cadence:** On-demand / Trigger-based
- **First Run Behavior:** Fire immediately on start
- **Durability:** Durable (survives session restarts via status file)
- **Off-Hours Behavior:** Paused overnight
- **Self-Cleanup:** Automatically deletes scheduler when watchlist is empty

## Preconditions

- System is in a stable, known state.
- Approvals and access controls for Deployment Validation are validated.
## External State

- Version control systems
- CI/CD pipelines
- Observability and telemetry dashboards---

## Connectors (MCP)

- **Required Servers:** github-server, filesystem-server
- **Permissions:** Read-only access to source code, Write access to docs/loops/
- **PR/Ticket Operations:** Allowed to open/update PRs, create issues, and add comments
- **Identity:** Bot Identity: "AEOS Loop Engine — LOOP-402"

## Required Context

- Current architecture baseline
- Task-specific constraints for Deployment Validation
## Agents

- Principal Engineering Agent
- Specialized Release Agents

**Role Context:** You are a highly precise, deterministic Agent executing this loop. You must strictly adhere to the Workflow and output schemas. You must not deviate from the defined scope. All actions must be auditable and verifiable.
## Workflow

1. **Initialization**: Gather context for Deployment Validation.
2. **Analysis**: Evaluate current state and plan actions.
3. **Execution**: Perform the core Deployment Validation tasks.
4. **Validation**: Verify success criteria.
5. **Finalization**: Commit changes and output reports.

**Execution Constraints:** Execution must be purely deterministic. The agent must proceed sequentially from step 1 to the final step. Parallel execution of sequential steps is forbidden. If a step fails, the agent must immediately proceed to the Failure Recovery procedure.
## Verification

- Automated testing specific to Deployment Validation.
- Manual sanity checks if required by human gates.

**Self-Verification Chain:**
1. **Format Check:** Verify all outputs against the strict schema.
2. **Dependency Check:** Ensure all dependencies were satisfied.
3. **Logic Check:** Confirm no contradictory statements or unresolved placeholders remain.
4. **Final Affirmation:** The Checker Agent must explicitly affirm "Verification Passed" before clearing any Soft or Hard Gate.
## Reflection

- Agent logs the outcome of the Deployment Validation process.
- Metrics related to Release efficiency are recorded.
## Human Approval Gates

- Pre-execution authorization (if destructive)
- Post-execution review of Deployment Validation impact
## Failure Recovery

- Automatic rollback of changes.
- Alerting to the on-call engineer with context of the failure in Deployment Validation.
## Metrics

- Time to complete Deployment Validation
- Success/Failure rate
- Number of manual interventions
## Risks

- Unintended side-effects on interdependent Release systems.
- Timeouts during extensive Deployment Validation operations.---

## Cost & Limits

- **Token Budget:** Estimated budget of 500k tokens per run
- **Daily Budget Cap:** Daily cap of $5.00 across all runs, checked via loop-budget.md
- **Max Iterations:** Max 5 iterations per item per run
- **Max Auto-PRs:** Max 3 auto-PRs per day
- **Kill Switch Criteria:** Immediate halt if spending exceeds budget or loop iterations exceed 5

---

## Safety

- **Auto-Merge Policy:** No auto-merge allowed; human checker must approve PR merge
- **Secrets/Env Denylist:** Git changes to .env, keys, credentials, config/secrets are forbidden
- **Flake Handling:** Do not retry flaky tests; isolate and log test failure for manual triage

## Stop Conditions

- Critical errors encountered during Deployment Validation.
- Maximum retry limit reached.
## Deliverables

- A complete and validated state post-Deployment Validation.
- Audit trails of the operation.

**Strict Output Schema:** All deliverables must be strictly formatted. Markdown artifacts must comply with GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM). Data payloads must be strictly typed JSON matching the expected schema. No extraneous conversational text is permitted in final artifacts.
## Future Improvements

- Enhanced automation for edge cases in Deployment Validation.
- Tighter integration with downstream Release tools.
## Version History

- **0.1**: Initial generation of the Deployment Validation loop.
