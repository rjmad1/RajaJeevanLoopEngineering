## Purpose

To establish a standardized procedure and workflow for Dead Code Elimination within the Engineering lifecycle, ensuring consistency and reliability across the platform.
## Problem Statement

Without a dedicated Dead Code Elimination loop, teams often face ad-hoc execution, leading to fragmentation, potential regressions, and operational overhead during Engineering activities.
## Why This Loop Exists

This loop abstracts the complexity of Dead Code Elimination into a repeatable, automated pipeline, minimizing human error and standardizing the process across all services.
## Scope

Covers all primary operations related to Dead Code Elimination. Out of scope: specialized, off-band procedures not part of the standard Engineering workflows.
## Inputs

- Initial context regarding Dead Code Elimination
- Relevant source files and configurations
- Environmental constraints for Engineering
## Outputs

- Executed Dead Code Elimination changes
- Validation reports
- Documentation updates
## Dependencies

- External services required for Engineering
- Prior state validation
## Trigger

Triggered manually by an engineer or automatically via a scheduled Engineering orchestration event.---

## Scheduling

- **Cadence:** On-demand / Trigger-based
- **First Run Behavior:** Fire immediately on start
- **Durability:** Durable (survives session restarts via status file)
- **Off-Hours Behavior:** Paused overnight
- **Self-Cleanup:** Automatically deletes scheduler when watchlist is empty

## Preconditions

- System is in a stable, known state.
- Approvals and access controls for Dead Code Elimination are validated.
## External State

- Version control systems
- CI/CD pipelines
- Observability and telemetry dashboards---

## Connectors (MCP)

- **Required Servers:** github-server, filesystem-server
- **Permissions:** Read-only access to source code, Write access to docs/loops/
- **PR/Ticket Operations:** Allowed to open/update PRs, create issues, and add comments
- **Identity:** Bot Identity: "AEOS Loop Engine — LOOP-113"

## Required Context

- Current architecture baseline
- Task-specific constraints for Dead Code Elimination
## Agents

- Principal Engineering Agent
- Specialized Engineering Agents

**Role Context:** You are a highly precise, deterministic Agent executing this loop. You must strictly adhere to the Workflow and output schemas. You must not deviate from the defined scope. All actions must be auditable and verifiable.
## Workflow

1. **Initialization**: Gather context for Dead Code Elimination.
2. **Analysis**: Evaluate current state and plan actions.
3. **Execution**: Perform the core Dead Code Elimination tasks.
4. **Validation**: Verify success criteria.
5. **Finalization**: Commit changes and output reports.

**Execution Constraints:** Execution must be purely deterministic. The agent must proceed sequentially from step 1 to the final step. Parallel execution of sequential steps is forbidden. If a step fails, the agent must immediately proceed to the Failure Recovery procedure.
## Verification

- Automated testing specific to Dead Code Elimination.
- Manual sanity checks if required by human gates.

**Self-Verification Chain:**
1. **Format Check:** Verify all outputs against the strict schema.
2. **Dependency Check:** Ensure all dependencies were satisfied.
3. **Logic Check:** Confirm no contradictory statements or unresolved placeholders remain.
4. **Final Affirmation:** The Checker Agent must explicitly affirm "Verification Passed" before clearing any Soft or Hard Gate.
## Reflection

- Agent logs the outcome of the Dead Code Elimination process.
- Metrics related to Engineering efficiency are recorded.
## Human Approval Gates

- Pre-execution authorization (if destructive)
- Post-execution review of Dead Code Elimination impact
## Failure Recovery

- Automatic rollback of changes.
- Alerting to the on-call engineer with context of the failure in Dead Code Elimination.
## Metrics

- Time to complete Dead Code Elimination
- Success/Failure rate
- Number of manual interventions
## Risks

- Unintended side-effects on interdependent Engineering systems.
- Timeouts during extensive Dead Code Elimination operations.---

## Cost & Limits

- **Token Budget:** Estimated budget of 500k tokens per run
- **Daily Budget Cap:** Daily cap of $5.00 across all runs, checked via loop-budget.md
- **Max Iterations:** Max 5 iterations per item per run
- **Max Auto-PRs:** Max 3 auto-PRs per day
- **Kill Switch Criteria:** Immediate halt if spending exceeds budget or loop iterations exceed 5

---

## Safety

- **Auto-Merge Policy:** No auto-merge allowed; human checker must approve PR merge
- **Secrets/Env Denylist:** Git changes to .env, keys, credentials, config/secrets are forbidden
- **Flake Handling:** Do not retry flaky tests; isolate and log test failure for manual triage

## Stop Conditions

- Critical errors encountered during Dead Code Elimination.
- Maximum retry limit reached.
## Deliverables

- A complete and validated state post-Dead Code Elimination.
- Audit trails of the operation.

**Strict Output Schema:** All deliverables must be strictly formatted. Markdown artifacts must comply with GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM). Data payloads must be strictly typed JSON matching the expected schema. No extraneous conversational text is permitted in final artifacts.
## Future Improvements

- Enhanced automation for edge cases in Dead Code Elimination.
- Tighter integration with downstream Engineering tools.
## Version History

- **0.1**: Initial generation of the Dead Code Elimination loop.
