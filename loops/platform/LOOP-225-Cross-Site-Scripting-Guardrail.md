## Purpose

To establish a standardized procedure and workflow for Cross-Site Scripting Guardrail within the Platform lifecycle, ensuring consistency and reliability across the platform.
## Problem Statement

Without a dedicated Cross-Site Scripting Guardrail loop, teams often face ad-hoc execution, leading to fragmentation, potential regressions, and operational overhead during Platform activities.
## Why This Loop Exists

This loop abstracts the complexity of Cross-Site Scripting Guardrail into a repeatable, automated pipeline, minimizing human error and standardizing the process across all services.
## Scope

Covers all primary operations related to Cross-Site Scripting Guardrail. Out of scope: specialized, off-band procedures not part of the standard Platform workflows.
## Inputs

- Initial context regarding Cross-Site Scripting Guardrail
- Relevant source files and configurations
- Environmental constraints for Platform
## Outputs

- Executed Cross-Site Scripting Guardrail changes
- Validation reports
- Documentation updates
## Dependencies

- External services required for Platform
- Prior state validation
## Trigger

Triggered manually by an engineer or automatically via a scheduled Platform orchestration event.---

## Scheduling

- **Cadence:** On-demand / Trigger-based
- **First Run Behavior:** Fire immediately on start
- **Durability:** Durable (survives session restarts via status file)
- **Off-Hours Behavior:** Paused overnight
- **Self-Cleanup:** Automatically deletes scheduler when watchlist is empty

## Preconditions

- System is in a stable, known state.
- Approvals and access controls for Cross-Site Scripting Guardrail are validated.
## External State

- Version control systems
- CI/CD pipelines
- Observability and telemetry dashboards---

## Connectors (MCP)

- **Required Servers:** github-server, filesystem-server
- **Permissions:** Read-only access to source code, Write access to docs/loops/
- **PR/Ticket Operations:** Allowed to open/update PRs, create issues, and add comments
- **Identity:** Bot Identity: "AEOS Loop Engine — LOOP-225"

## Required Context

- Current architecture baseline
- Task-specific constraints for Cross-Site Scripting Guardrail
## Agents

- Principal Engineering Agent
- Specialized Platform Agents

**Role Context:** You are a highly precise, deterministic Agent executing this loop. You must strictly adhere to the Workflow and output schemas. You must not deviate from the defined scope. All actions must be auditable and verifiable.
## Workflow

1. **Initialization**: Gather context for Cross-Site Scripting Guardrail.
2. **Analysis**: Evaluate current state and plan actions.
3. **Execution**: Perform the core Cross-Site Scripting Guardrail tasks.
4. **Validation**: Verify success criteria.
5. **Finalization**: Commit changes and output reports.

**Execution Constraints:** Execution must be purely deterministic. The agent must proceed sequentially from step 1 to the final step. Parallel execution of sequential steps is forbidden. If a step fails, the agent must immediately proceed to the Failure Recovery procedure.
## Verification

- Automated testing specific to Cross-Site Scripting Guardrail.
- Manual sanity checks if required by human gates.

**Self-Verification Chain:**
1. **Format Check:** Verify all outputs against the strict schema.
2. **Dependency Check:** Ensure all dependencies were satisfied.
3. **Logic Check:** Confirm no contradictory statements or unresolved placeholders remain.
4. **Final Affirmation:** The Checker Agent must explicitly affirm "Verification Passed" before clearing any Soft or Hard Gate.
## Reflection

- Agent logs the outcome of the Cross-Site Scripting Guardrail process.
- Metrics related to Platform efficiency are recorded.
## Human Approval Gates

- Pre-execution authorization (if destructive)
- Post-execution review of Cross-Site Scripting Guardrail impact
## Failure Recovery

- Automatic rollback of changes.
- Alerting to the on-call engineer with context of the failure in Cross-Site Scripting Guardrail.
## Metrics

- Time to complete Cross-Site Scripting Guardrail
- Success/Failure rate
- Number of manual interventions
## Risks

- Unintended side-effects on interdependent Platform systems.
- Timeouts during extensive Cross-Site Scripting Guardrail operations.---

## Cost & Limits

- **Token Budget:** Estimated budget of 500k tokens per run
- **Daily Budget Cap:** Daily cap of $5.00 across all runs, checked via loop-budget.md
- **Max Iterations:** Max 5 iterations per item per run
- **Max Auto-PRs:** Max 3 auto-PRs per day
- **Kill Switch Criteria:** Immediate halt if spending exceeds budget or loop iterations exceed 5

---

## Safety

- **Auto-Merge Policy:** No auto-merge allowed; human checker must approve PR merge
- **Secrets/Env Denylist:** Git changes to .env, keys, credentials, config/secrets are forbidden
- **Flake Handling:** Do not retry flaky tests; isolate and log test failure for manual triage

## Stop Conditions

- Critical errors encountered during Cross-Site Scripting Guardrail.
- Maximum retry limit reached.
## Deliverables

- A complete and validated state post-Cross-Site Scripting Guardrail.
- Audit trails of the operation.

**Strict Output Schema:** All deliverables must be strictly formatted. Markdown artifacts must comply with GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM). Data payloads must be strictly typed JSON matching the expected schema. No extraneous conversational text is permitted in final artifacts.
## Future Improvements

- Enhanced automation for edge cases in Cross-Site Scripting Guardrail.
- Tighter integration with downstream Platform tools.
## Version History

- **0.1**: Initial generation of the Cross-Site Scripting Guardrail loop.
